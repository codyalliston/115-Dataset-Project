# 115-Dataset-Project

This dataset contains housing pricing data for Washington State and also averages for the United States. Data found at this website can be used to identify markets and submarkets that are trending higher and lower than the national market. Based on how well individual markets and submarkets are performing, it an be inferred that certain areas would be worth more investment. This could mean updating older communities that already exist in thriving markets in order to increase rental rates, adding capital improvements to successful communities, and even building new apartment communities from the ground up.

Initial data was presented in column, which are not very helpful for visualization. Included here is raw data showing the national average of house pricing over time. In order to be loaded into RStudio, the data was first transferred into Excel where it could then be imported and transformed into graphics that are useful. All data was taken from the attached website.

The attached graphic uses a technique learned in this class: a plot of data imported from outside of RStudio. It shows that the national average is climbing. Next steps would include plotting these averages against Washington State averages and then digging further into individual submarkets to see which areas in Washington would be best suited to invest.
